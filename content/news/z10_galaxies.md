A new study led by Prof. Keller comparing recent JWST observations to simulation
models of galaxy formation has been accepted in the Astrophysical Journal
Letters.

With the launch of the JWST, a number of exciting new detections of galaxies in
the extremely early universe have been reported.  Unfortunately, many of these
have relied on relatively uncertain estimates of their distances.  In December
2022, the JADES team reported 
[the first galaxies above redshift 10 with high-accuracy spectroscopy.](git@github.com:bwkeller/mgs-web.git)

Prof. Keller, and his collaborators Prof. Ferah Munshi, Dr. Maxime Trebitsch,
and Prof. Michael Tremmel compared these new observations with a number of
existing simulations of galaxy formation to determine whether these JWST
observations break modern theories for galaxy formation.  In brief, they found
it does not!  Our understanding of galaxy formation seems to work well even for
galaxies formed in the first 500 million years of the Universe's history!
