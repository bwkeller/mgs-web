Prof. Keller's Community of Research Scholars (CoRS) Grant "Exploring Synergies
in Astrophysical and Engineering Simulations" was funded!

<!--more-->

Working with Prof. Lee from the University of Memphis Department of Mechanical
Engineering, the MGS group will be working to explore different methods for
hydrodynamical simulations used in the astrophysics and engineering fields.
Surprisingly, there is a lot of overlap between simulations of galaxies and
simulations of wind turbines!

This CoRS grant will provide us with $2500 to help purchase hardware and fund a
summer undergraduate researcher to investigate where we can improve simulations
in both astrophysics and engineering research by sharing ideas and methods.
