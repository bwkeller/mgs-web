A new study by Prof. Keller comparing Dragonfly telescope observations to
simulation models of galaxy formation has been accepted in the Astrophysical
Journal Letters.

In 2020, a paper by Dr. Allison Merritt and the Illustris-TNG team reported a
[potentially serious problem in simulations of galaxy
formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11402):  simulated galaxies produced far
too many stars in the outskirts of galaxy halos, the diffuse "cloud" of stars
that surround galaxy discs.

Using simulations from the MUGS and MUGS2 suite of galaxies, Prof. Keller was
able to show that these differences arise from the different choices for
modelling small-scale supernova (SN) physics in these simulations.  With
stronger SN feedback in low-mass galaxies, the observed properties of real
galaxies can be well-matched in simulations.
