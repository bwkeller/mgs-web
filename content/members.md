Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.memphis.edu">University of Memphis</a>
as an Assistant Professor in 2022.  Prior to joining the UofM, Ben worked as a
postdoctoral researcher and Alexander von Humboldt fellow at the Universität
Heidelberg.  He obtained his PhD in Physics at McMaster University in 2017, and
his BSc in Physics and Computer Science from the University of Calgary in 2011.</div>

Mst. Shamima Khanom have joined the PhD program at the department of Physics and
Material Science in the Memphis University, USA, in the Spring 2022. She
completed her B. Sc. (Hons.) and M. S. (Thesis) in Physics from Jahangirnagar
University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. She successfully completed her M. S. thesis under
the supervision of Prof. Dr. Md. Abul Hossain and her M.Sc. thesis deals in the
simulation of the efficiency of a four layered multijunction solar cell.

Now she is working on Astrophysics with in the MGS group. Her research focus
is on the co-evolution of galaxies and their supermassive black holes.

Zachary Wyatt is a PhD student at the University of Memphis. He received his BSc
in Physics from Memphis and continues to compete on the Track and Field and
Cross Country Teams at the NCAA Division 1 level.  Originally from Vancouver,
Zachary represented Canada at the 2019 U20 Pan American Track and Field
Championships in Costa Rica. A passion for running allowed for an opportunity to
study and compete in the United States, and Zachary's enthusiasm for physics
continues to fuel his academic endeavors.  Along with a curiosity for
astrophysics, he is particularly interested in computer simulations and is eager
to work with the MGS group.</div>

Javier Saavedra recieved his B. Sc in Physics with a minor in Astronomy from the Universidad Católica del Norte in Chile in 2018. After a long time of being a teaching assistant for his physics department. He was finally able to start his graduate studies at the University of Memphis the fall 2022 semester. His research interests are applications of fractional calculus in physics but he's now focused on working with the MGS group. 

Much like his hair would suggest he wants to be Brian May will not shut up about music and/or guitars if given the chance.
