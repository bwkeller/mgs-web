Dan is a native Memphian, but he has lived abroad in France, China, and the
Philippines. He’s the oddball cyclist spotted in the wild streets of Memphis
commuting to and fro.

Astro wasn’t always his thing…his first career was in finance. After a decade in
the corporate world, which included an MSBA Finance, a couple of small
businesses, and overseas assignments, he decided to embark on a completely new
journey. Dan engineered his life in such a way that he can now pursue a
full-time undergraduate degree in physics and chemistry – with the eventual aim
to earn a PhD. His budding (and rapidly evolving) interests include detecting
life on exoplanets, star evolution and chemical production and transport, and
cosmological quandaries.

Dan and his spouse Makee enjoy international travel, learning languages, and
nerding out over spreadsheets.
