# Memphis Galaxy Simulation Group

Welcome to the Memphis Galaxy Simulation group at the University of Memphis.
Here at the MGS group, we use supercomputer simulations and analytic theory to
understand how the galaxies we observe form and evolve over cosmic time.  Our
work mostly focuses on the "cosmic baryon cycle", the process by which baryons
(the normal matter that makes up everything we can see) fall into galaxies to
form stars, which can then eject these baryons through processes called
"feedback".
